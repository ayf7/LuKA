Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the gene\u2013environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.\n\n\nQuestion 4: What is one instantly visible genetic trait?\n\n# Segment 5: University\n\nThe original Latin word \"universitas\" refers in general to \"a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc.\" At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds, specialised \"associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located\" came to be denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members.\n\n\nQuestion 5: What is the original greek word for university?\n\n# Segment 6: University\n\nThe original Latin word \"universitas\" refers in general to \"a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc.\" At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds, specialised \"associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located\" came to be denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members.\n\n\nQuestion 6: What does the greek work \"universitas\" mean?\n\n# Segment 7: Gene\n\nGenes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term \"having a gene\" (e.g., \"good genes,\" \"hair colour gene\") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene.\n\n\nQuestion 7: What do alleles do?\n\n# Segment 8: Gene\n\nGenes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population.

One of the most remote islands in the world, it was for centuries an important stopover for ships sailing to Europe from Asia and South Africa. Napoleon was imprisoned there in exile by the British, as were Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo (for leading a Zulu army against British rule) and more than 5,000 Boers taken prisoner during the Second Boer War.\n\n\nQuestion 7: Why was Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo imprisoned on the island?\n\n# Segment 8: Saint_Helena\n\nBetween 1791 and 1833, Saint Helena became the site of a series of experiments in conservation, reforestation and attempts to boost rainfall artificially. This environmental intervention was closely linked to the conceptualisation of the processes of environmental change and helped establish the roots of environmentalism.\n\n\nQuestion 8: The roots of what were established on Saint Helena?\n",

Napoleon supported the French Revolution from the outset in 1789 while serving in the French army, and he tried to spread its ideals to Corsica but was banished from the island in 1793. Two years later, he saved the French government from collapse by firing on the Parisian mobs with cannons.\n\n\nQuestion 6: Where was Napoleon born?\n\n# Segment 7: Hydrogen\n\nThe universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2.
