Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad, a proof of his prophethood, and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad. The word \"Quran\" occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran, although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran.\n\n\nQuestion 1: Which angel is believed to have communicated the Quran to Muhammad?\n\n# Segment 2: Quran\n\nMuslims believe the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel (Jibril), gradually over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death.

Consequently, Weinreich gives the definition \"A person's identity is defined as the totality of one's self-construal, in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future\"; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as: \"One's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity\" (Weinreich, 1986a).\n\n\nQuestion 4: A person's identity is defined as the totality of what?\n\n# Segment 5: Identity_(social_science)\n\nA psychological identity relates to self-image (one's mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality.

Shortly after Muhammad's death, the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it. These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman's codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today.\n\n\nQuestion 11: Who first recorded Muhammad revelations?\n\n# Segment 12: Quran\n\nAccording to the traditional narrative, several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations.

How should one describe the identity of another, in ways which encompass both their idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications, both of which can shift according to circumstance? Following on from the work of Kelly, Erikson, Tajfel and others Weinreich's Identity Structure Analysis (ISA), is \"a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time \u2026 with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions\" (Weinreich and Saunderson, (eds) 2003, p1). Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms, the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual, applied across time and milieus by the \"situated self\" to appraise self and other agents and institutions (for example, resulting in the individual's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions).[citation needed]\n\n\nQuestion 13: What provides a method that maps how cultural norms are used by the group?\n\n# Segment 14: Identity_(social_science)\n\nThe description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where \"identity\" needs to be mapped and defined.

His parents were Gustav Schwarzenegger (August 17, 1907 \u2013 December 13, 1972), and Aurelia Schwarzenegger (n\u00e9e Jadrny; July 29, 1922 \u2013 August 2, 1998). Gustav was the local chief of police, and had served in World War II as a Hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the Nazi Party in 1938, though he was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria.\n\n\nQuestion 16: What was Schwarzenegger's dad's job in their town?\n\n# Segment 17: Arnold_Schwarzenegger\n\nGustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard (July 17, 1946 \u2013 May 20, 1971), over Arnold. His favoritism was \"strong and blatant,\" which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child. Schwarzenegger has said his father had \"no patience for listening or understanding your problems.\" Schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death.\n\n\nQuestion 17: What was Schwarzenegger's older brother's name?\n\n# Segment 18: Arnold_Schwarzenegger\n\nGustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard (July 17, 1946 \u2013 May 20, 1971), over Arnold.

Since pitch is such a close proxy for frequency, it is almost entirely determined by how quickly the sound wave is making the air vibrate and has almost nothing to do with the intensity, or amplitude, of the wave. That is, \"high\" pitch means very rapid oscillation, and \"low\" pitch corresponds to slower oscillation.\n\n\nQuestion 13: Pitch is a close proxy for what?\n\n# Segment 14: Pitch_(music)\n\nAccording to the American National Standards Institute, pitch is the auditory attribute of sound according to which sounds can be ordered on a scale from low to high.

Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call \"humane\" or \"polite\" learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia.

The bulk of western and central Tibet (\u00dc-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.\n\n\nQuestion 13: Which Chinese provinces used to be the eastern part of Tibet?\n\n# Segment 14: Tibet\n\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories.

Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes.\n\n\nQuestion 4: What type of food are grapes?\n\n# Segment 5: Grape\n\nGrapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. \"White\" grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape. Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes.\n\n\nQuestion 5: How many grapes are generally in a cluster?\n\n# Segment 6: Grape\n\nThe cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000\u20138,000 years ago in the Near East. Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the innovation of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia.\n\n\nQuestion 6: How long ago were grapes first cultivated?\n\n# Segment 7: FA_Cup\n\nThe competition is open to any eligible club down to Levels 10 of the English football league system - all 92 professional clubs in the Premier League and Football League (Levels 1 to 4), and several hundred \"non-league\" teams in Steps 1 to 6 of the National League System (Levels 5 to 10). A record 763 clubs competed in 2011\u201312. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final.\n\n\nQuestion 7: How many clubs competed before 2011?\n\n# Segment 8: FA_Cup\n\nThe competition is open to any eligible club down to Levels 10 of the English football league system - all 92 professional clubs in the Premier League and Football League (Levels 1 to 4), and several hundred \"non-league\" teams in Steps 1 to 6 of the National League System (Levels 5 to 10).

The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final.\n\n\nQuestion 9: What is the maximum number of games needed to win?\n\n# Segment 10: Race_(human_categorization)\n\nThere is a wide consensus that the racial categories that are common in everyday usage are socially constructed, and that racial groups cannot be biologically defined. Nonetheless, some scholars argue that racial categories obviously correlate with biological traits (e.g. phenotype) to some degree, and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations, some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings.\n\n\nQuestion 10: What is the majority opinion on whether racial categories can be considered to have impact on human genetic variation? \n\n# Segment 11: Race_(human_categorization)\n\nWhen people define and talk about a particular conception of race, they create a social reality through which social categorization is achieved. In this sense, races are said to be social constructs. These constructs develop within various legal, economic, and sociopolitical contexts, and may be the effect, rather than the cause, of major social situations.\n\n\nQuestion 11: How do people create a social reality in which social categorization is achieved?\n\n# Segment 12: Race_(human_categorization)\n\nWhen people define and talk about a particular conception of race, they create a social reality through which social categorization is achieved.

This phenomenon has been termed the French paradox, and is thought to occur from protective benefits of regularly consuming red wine. Apart from potential benefits of alcohol itself, including reduced platelet aggregation and vasodilation, polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol) mainly in the grape skin provide other suspected health benefits, such as:\n\n\nQuestion 13: What is the phenomenon that shows that the French have less heart disease, even though they eat more animal fat?\n\n# Segment 14: Grape\n\nComparing diets among Western countries, researchers have discovered that although the French tend to eat higher levels of animal fat, the incidence of heart disease remains low in France.

The juice is often sold in stores or fermented and made into wine, brandy, or vinegar. Grape juice that has been pasteurized, removing any naturally occurring yeast, will not ferment if kept sterile, and thus contains no alcohol.\n\n\nQuestion 15: What juice is made when grapes are crushed and blended?\n\n# Segment 16: FA_Cup\n\nThe first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 92 professional teams. The last entrants are the Premier League and Championship clubs, into the draw for the Third Round Proper. In the modern era, non-league teams have never reached the quarter finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final.[note 1] As a result, as well as who wins, significant focus is given to those \"minnows\" (smaller teams) who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely \"giant-killing\" victory.\n\n\nQuestion 16: How many teams do not progress to the first round of the Competition Proper?\n\n# Segment 17: FA_Cup\n\nThe first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 92 professional teams.

In international club football, Barcelona has won five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, a shared record five UEFA Super Cup, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and a record three FIFA Club World Cup trophies.

As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club. This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.\n\n\nQuestion 6: In 1925 what incident by the crowd caused the closing of the stadium?\n\n# Segment 7: Alloy\n\nAn alloy is a mixture of metals or a mixture of a metal and another element. Alloys are defined by metallic bonding character. An alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements (a single phase) or a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions).\n\n\nQuestion 7: What type of solution has a single phase in two or more solutions?\n\n# Segment 8: Alloy\n\nAn alloy is a mixture of metals or a mixture of a metal and another element.

An alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements (a single phase) or a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions).\n\n\nQuestion 8: What type of phases are always considered to be alloys?\n\n# Segment 9: Alloy\n\nAn alloy is a mixture of either pure or fairly pure chemical elements, which forms an impure substance (admixture) that retains the characteristics of a metal. An alloy is distinct from an impure metal, such as wrought iron, in that, with an alloy, the added impurities are usually desirable and will typically have some useful benefit. Alloys are made by mixing two or more elements; at least one of which being a metal.\n\n\nQuestion 9: What kind of substance is an alloy?\n\n# Segment 10: Grape\n\nThe cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000\u20138,000 years ago in the Near East. Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the innovation of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia.\n\n\nQuestion 10: How do we know that wine was made in ancient Egypt?\n\n# Segment 11: Grape\n\nComparing diets among Western countries, researchers have discovered that although the French tend to eat higher levels of animal fat, the incidence of heart disease remains low in France. This phenomenon has been termed the French paradox, and is thought to occur from protective benefits of regularly consuming red wine. Apart from potential benefits of alcohol itself, including reduced platelet aggregation and vasodilation, polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol) mainly in the grape skin provide other suspected health benefits, such as:\n\n\nQuestion 11: What do people in France eat more of that in most western countries?\n\n# Segment 12: Grape\n\nComparing diets among Western countries, researchers have discovered that although the French tend to eat higher levels of animal fat, the incidence of heart disease remains low in France.

Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George.\n\n\nQuestion 13: What dictator's rule was Cruyff's reason for avoiding Real Madrid?\n\n# Segment 14: FC_Barcelona\n\nThe 1973\u201374 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record \u00a3920,000 from Ajax.

Alloys are made by mixing two or more elements; at least one of which being a metal.\n\n\nQuestion 17: What other metal is pure like an alloy?\n\n# Segment 18: Alloy\n\nWhen the alloy cools and solidifies (crystallizes), its mechanical properties will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents. A metal that is normally very soft and malleable, such as aluminium, can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, like copper. Although both metals are very soft and ductile, the resulting aluminium alloy will be much harder and stronger.\n\n\nQuestion 18: How is steel produced?\n",

The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement; a subsequent conflict, known as Pontiac's War, was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status.

    "prompt": "# Segment 1: Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Americas are the descendants of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas. Pueblos ind\u00edgenas (indigenous peoples) is a common term in Spanish-speaking countries. Aborigen (aboriginal/native) is used in Argentina, whereas \"Amerindian\" is used in Quebec, The Guianas, and the English-speaking Caribbean.\n\n\nQuestion 1: Who are the indigenous people of the Americas descended from?\n\n# Segment 2: Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Americas are the descendants of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas.

Pueblos ind\u00edgenas (indigenous peoples) is a common term in Spanish-speaking countries. Aborigen (aboriginal/native) is used in Argentina, whereas \"Amerindian\" is used in Quebec, The Guianas, and the English-speaking Caribbean.\n\n\nQuestion 3: What term is used in Argentina to refer to the original peoples of a continent?\n\n# Segment 4: Botany\n\nBotany, also called plant science(s) or plant biology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specializes in this field. The term \"botany\" comes from the Ancient Greek word \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 (botan\u0113) meaning \"pasture\", \"grass\", or \"fodder\"; \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 is in turn derived from \u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (boskein), \"to feed\" or \"to graze\".\n\n\nQuestion 4: Does botany only study plants?\n\n# Segment 5: Botany\n\nBotany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans to identify \u2013 and later cultivate \u2013 edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards.\n\n\nQuestion 5: What science led to botany?\n\n# Segment 6: Botany\n\nBotany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans to identify \u2013 and later cultivate \u2013 edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards.\n\n\nQuestion 6: What kind of plants did monasteries cultivate?\n\n# Segment 7: Santa_Monica,_California\n\nSanta Monica is a beachfront city in western Los Angeles County, California, United States. The city is named after the Christian saint, Monica. Situated on Santa Monica Bay, it is bordered on three sides by the city of Los Angeles \u2013 Pacific Palisades to the north, Brentwood on the northeast, Sawtelle on the east, Mar Vista on the southeast, and Venice on the south.\n\n\nQuestion 7: What lies to the west of Santa Monica?\n\n# Segment 8: Santa_Monica,_California\n\nSanta Monica is a beachfront city in western Los Angeles County, California, United States. The city is named after the Christian saint, Monica. Situated on Santa Monica Bay, it is bordered on three sides by the city of Los Angeles \u2013 Pacific Palisades to the north, Brentwood on the northeast, Sawtelle on the east, Mar Vista on the southeast, and Venice on the south.\n\n\nQuestion 8: How many condominiums are there in Santa Monica?\n\n# Segment 9: Santa_Monica,_California\n\nSanta Monica is a beachfront city in western Los Angeles County, California, United States. The city is named after the Christian saint, Monica. Situated on Santa Monica Bay, it is bordered on three sides by the city of Los Angeles \u2013 Pacific Palisades to the north, Brentwood on the northeast, Sawtelle on the east, Mar Vista on the southeast, and Venice on the south.\n\n\nQuestion 9: What's the population of Brentwood?\n\n# Segment 10: Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\n\nAccording to the prevailing theories of the settlement of the Americas, migrations of humans from Asia (in particular North Asia) to the Americas took place via Beringia, a land bridge which connected the two continents across what is now the Bering Strait. The majority of experts agree that the earliest pre-modern human migration via Beringia took place at least 13,500 years ago, with disputed evidence that people had migrated into the Americas much earlier, up to 40,000 years ago. These early Paleo-Indians spread throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.\n\n\nQuestion 10: How do the indigenous peoples explain how they came to live in the Americas?\n\n# Segment 11: Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\n\nApplication of the term \"Indian\" originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies. The Americas came to be known as the \"West Indies\", a name still used to refer to the islands of the Caribbean Sea. This led to the names \"Indies\" and \"Indian\", which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the aboriginal peoples of the Americas.\n\n\nQuestion 11: What incorrect term for the indigenous population originated with Christopher Columbus? \n\n# Segment 12: Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\n\nApplication of the term \"Indian\" originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies. The Americas came to be known as the \"West Indies\", a name still used to refer to the islands of the Caribbean Sea. This led to the names \"Indies\" and \"Indian\", which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the aboriginal peoples of the Americas.\n\n\nQuestion 12: Where did Columbus believe he had arrived?\n\n# Segment 13: Botany\n\nModern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with inputs from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant structure, growth and differentiation, reproduction, biochemistry and primary metabolism, chemical products, development, diseases, evolutionary relationships, systematics, and plant taxonomy. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are molecular genetics and epigenetics, which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of plant cells and tissues.\n\n\nQuestion 13: Is botany a narrow science?\n\n# Segment 14: Botany\n\nAnother work from Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De Materia Medica, a five-volume encyclopedia about herbal medicine written in the middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides. De Materia Medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years. Important contributions from the medieval Muslim world include Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture, Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfa D\u012bnawar\u012b's (828\u2013896) the Book of Plants, and Ibn Bassal's The Classification of Soils.\n\n\nQuestion 14: What is the name of an ancient Greek work impacting botany?\n\n# Segment 15: Botany\n\nAnother work from Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De Materia Medica, a five-volume encyclopedia about herbal medicine written in the middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides.

Santa Monica was called Kecheek in the Tongva language. The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portol\u00e0, who camped near the present day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769.\n\n\nQuestion 16: What language did Gaspar de Portola speak?\n\n# Segment 17: Santa_Monica,_California\n\nSanta Monica was long inhabited by the Tongva people.

Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What is the center of the nervous system in all creatures?\n\n# Segment 2: Brain\n\nThe brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals.

Often abbreviated to Saint-Barth in French, or St. Barts or St.\n\n\nQuestion 4: What did the native peoples of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy call the island?\n\n# Segment 5: Saint_Barth%C3%A9lemy\n\nSaint-Barth\u00e9lemy (French: Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, French pronunciation: \u200b[s\u025b\u0303ba\u0281telemi]), officially the Territorial collectivity of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy (French: Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy), is an overseas collectivity of France.

With approximately 182 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world. Nigeria has one of the largest populations of youth in the world.\n\n\nQuestion 7: How many people live in Nigeria?\n\n# Segment 8: Nigeria\n\nNigeria is often referred to as the \"Giant of Africa\", owing to its large population and economy.

Nigeria has one of the largest populations of youth in the world.\n\n\nQuestion 9: How many languages are spoken by Nigerians?\n\n# Segment 10: Brain\n\nThis article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article.\n\n\nQuestion 10: Animals with a spine are called what?\n\n# Segment 11: Brain\n\nThe shape and size of the brain varies greatly in different species, and identifying common features is often difficult. Nevertheless, there are a number of principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species. Some aspects of brain structure are common to almost the entire range of animal species; others distinguish \"advanced\" brains from more primitive ones, or distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates.\n\n\nQuestion 11: Animals without a spine are called what?\n\n# Segment 12: Brain\n\nThe simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color.\n\n\nQuestion 12: The easiest way to learn about brain anatomy is by what?\n\n# Segment 13: Saint_Barth%C3%A9lemy\n\nSaint Barth\u00e9lemy, a volcanic island fully encircled by shallow reefs, has an area of 25 square kilometres (9.7 sq mi) and a population of 9,035 (Jan. 2011 estimate). Its capital is Gustavia[citation needed], which also contains the main harbour to the island.\n\n\nQuestion 13: What is the capital of St. Barts?\n\n# Segment 14: Saint_Barth%C3%A9lemy\n\nSaint Barth\u00e9lemy, a volcanic island fully encircled by shallow reefs, has an area of 25 square kilometres (9.7 sq mi) and a population of 9,035 (Jan. 2011 estimate). Its capital is Gustavia[citation needed], which also contains the main harbour to the island.\n\n\nQuestion 14: What country besides France had colonies on the island for a substantial period of time?\n\n# Segment 15: Saint_Barth%C3%A9lemy\n\nSaint Barth\u00e9lemy, a volcanic island fully encircled by shallow reefs, has an area of 25 square kilometres (9.7 sq mi) and a population of 9,035 (Jan. 2011 estimate). Its capital is Gustavia[citation needed], which also contains the main harbour to the island.\n\n\nQuestion 15: When is the busiest time for tourism in St. Barts?\n\n# Segment 16: Nigeria\n\nSince 2002, the North East of the country has seen sectarian violence by Boko Haram, an Islamist movement that seeks to abolish the secular system of government and establish Sharia law. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in May 2014 claimed that Boko Haram attacks have left at least 12,000 people dead and 8,000 people crippled. At the same time, neighbouring countries, Benin, Chad, Cameroon and Niger joined Nigeria in a united effort to combat Boko Haram in the aftermath of a world media highlighted kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls and the spread of Boko Haram attacks to these countries.\n\n\nQuestion 16: When did Boko Haram become active in Nigeria?\n\n# Segment 17: Nigeria\n\nSince 2002, the North East of the country has seen sectarian violence by Boko Haram, an Islamist movement that seeks to abolish the secular system of government and establish Sharia law. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in May 2014 claimed that Boko Haram attacks have left at least 12,000 people dead and 8,000 people crippled.

Architectural structures built with copper corrode to give green verdigris (or patina).\n\n\nQuestion 6: Where was copper glowing at in the Roman era?\n\n# Segment 7: Nutrition\n\nAccording to Walter Gratzer, the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of Qi developed, a spirit or \"wind\" similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma. Food was classified into \"hot\" (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and \"cold\" (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia.\n\n\nQuestion 7: What kind of food classification does ginger belong to?\n\n# Segment 8: Nutrition\n\nAccording to Walter Gratzer, the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC.

Ashkenaz is linked to Scandza/Scanzia, viewed as the cradle of Germanic tribes, as early as a 6th-century gloss to the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius. In the 10th-century History of Armenia of Yovhannes Drasxanakertc'i (1.15) Ashkenaz was associated with Armenia, as it was occasionally in Jewish usage, where its denotation extended at times to Adiabene, Khazaria, Crimea and areas to the east.\n\n\nQuestion 10: Ashkenaz is linked to Scandza/Scanzia, which is viewed as what?\n\n# Segment 11: Ashkenazi_Jews\n\nNo evidence has yet been found of a Jewish presence in antiquity in Germany beyond its Roman border, nor in Eastern Europe. In Gaul and Germany itself, with the possible exception of Trier and Cologne, the archeological evidence suggests at most a fleeting presence of very few Jews, primarily itinerant traders or artisans. A substantial Jewish population emerged in northern Gaul by the Middle Ages, but Jewish communities existed in 465 CE in Brittany, in 524 CE in Valence, and in 533 CE in Orleans.\n\n\nQuestion 11: Who expelled the Jews from his Merovingian kingdom in 629?\n\n# Segment 12: Ashkenazi_Jews\n\nNo evidence has yet been found of a Jewish presence in antiquity in Germany beyond its Roman border, nor in Eastern Europe.

It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper.\n\n\nQuestion 13: When was copper thought to have been discovered in China?\n\n# Segment 14: Copper\n\nCopper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record.

Galen was physician to gladiators in Pergamon, and in Rome, physician to Marcus Aurelius and the three emperors who succeeded him. Most of Galen's teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by Benedictine monks at the School of Salerno in Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum, which still had users in the 17th century.\n\n\nQuestion 16: Which famous emperor did Galen serve as a physician to?\n\n# Segment 17: Nutrition\n\nOne mustn't overlook the doctrines of Galen: In use from his life in the 1st century AD until the 17th century, it was heresy to disagree with him for 1500 years.

The United States did not recognize Liberia's independence until during the American Civil War on February 5, 1862.

Ashkenaz is linked to Scandza/Scanzia, viewed as the cradle of Germanic tribes, as early as a 6th-century gloss to the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius. In the 10th-century History of Armenia of Yovhannes Drasxanakertc'i (1.15) Ashkenaz was associated with Armenia, as it was occasionally in Jewish usage, where its denotation extended at times to Adiabene, Khazaria, Crimea and areas to the east.\n\n\nQuestion 10: Ashkenaz is linked to Scandza/Scanzia, which is viewed as what?\n\n# Segment 11: Ashkenazi_Jews\n\nNo evidence has yet been found of a Jewish presence in antiquity in Germany beyond its Roman border, nor in Eastern Europe. In Gaul and Germany itself, with the possible exception of Trier and Cologne, the archeological evidence suggests at most a fleeting presence of very few Jews, primarily itinerant traders or artisans. A substantial Jewish population emerged in northern Gaul by the Middle Ages, but Jewish communities existed in 465 CE in Brittany, in 524 CE in Valence, and in 533 CE in Orleans.\n\n\nQuestion 11: Who expelled the Jews from his Merovingian kingdom in 629?\n\n# Segment 12: Ashkenazi_Jews\n\nNo evidence has yet been found of a Jewish presence in antiquity in Germany beyond its Roman border, nor in Eastern Europe.

Five years of military rule by the People's Redemption Council and five years of civilian rule by the National Democratic Party of Liberia were followed by the First and Second Liberian Civil Wars.

Dual dating uses two consecutive years because of differences in the starting date of the year, or includes both the Julian and Gregorian dates. Old Style and New Style (N.S.) indicate either whether the start of the Julian year has been adjusted to start on 1 January (N.S.) even though documents written at the time use a different start of year (O.S.), or whether a date conforms to the Julian calendar (O.S.) rather than the Gregorian (N.S.).\n\n\nQuestion 7: What uses two different dates because of a difference in the ending date of the year?\n\n# Segment 8: Gregorian_calendar\n\nTo unambiguously specify the date, dual dating or Old Style (O.S.) and New Style (N.S.) are sometimes used with dates.

The Celts and the Romans were followed by the Visigothic and the Suebi Germanic peoples, who were themselves later invaded by the Moors. These Muslim peoples were eventually expelled during the Christian Reconquista of the peninsula.\n\n\nQuestion 10: What age did Portugal pioneer?\n\n# Segment 11: Portugal\n\nThe land within the borders of current Portugal has been continuously settled and fought over since prehistoric times.

These Muslim peoples were eventually expelled during the Christian Reconquista of the peninsula.\n\n\nQuestion 11: In which centuries did Portugal establish the first global empire?\n\n# Segment 12: Portugal\n\nPortugal lost much of its wealth and status with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of Brazil, its wealthiest colony, in 1822. After the 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy, the democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic was established, later being superseded by the \"Estado Novo\" right-wing authoritarian regime. Democracy was restored after the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution in 1974.\n\n\nQuestion 12: In Portugal, which city was destroyed in the 1755 earthquake?\n\n# Segment 13: Pesticide\n\nIn general, a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, mollusks, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors. Although pesticides have benefits, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species.\n\n\nQuestion 13: What are possible cons of pesticides?\n\n# Segment 14: Pesticide\n\nIn general, a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests.

Although pesticides have benefits, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species.\n\n\nQuestion 15: How many microbes exist that are dangerous to humans?\n\n# Segment 16: Gregorian_calendar\n\nThe Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582. The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. Although a recommendation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day, it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria (see Easter for the issues which arose).\n\n\nQuestion 16: What calendar was started in the fifteenth century?\n\n# Segment 17: Gregorian_calendar\n\nThe Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582.

The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with symbols and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago.[citation needed] This capacity is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex abilities for social learning.\n\n\nQuestion 9: Around when were humans able to understand to some degree what culture really meant?\n\n# Segment 10: Solar_energy\n\nThe Earth receives 174,000 terawatts (TW) of incoming solar radiation (insolation) at the upper atmosphere. Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet.\n\n\nQuestion 10: What are the insolation levels of most populated areas?\n\n# Segment 11: Solar_energy\n\nThe Earth receives 174,000 terawatts (TW) of incoming solar radiation (insolation) at the upper atmosphere. Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet.\n\n\nQuestion 11: Where is the solar radiation not reflected back to space absorbed?\n\n# Segment 12: Solar_energy\n\nSolar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans \u2013 which cover about 71% of the globe \u2013 and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle.\n\n\nQuestion 12: The Earth's oceans cover what percentage of the globe?\n\n# Segment 13: San_Diego\n\nHistorically home to the Kumeyaay people, San Diego was the first site visited by Europeans on what is now the West Coast of the United States. Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542, Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo claimed the entire area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later. The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1, founded in 1769, formed the first European settlement in what is now California.\n\n\nQuestion 13: What native people lived in the San Diego area before the Europeans arrived?\n\n# Segment 14: San_Diego\n\nHistorically home to the Kumeyaay people, San Diego was the first site visited by Europeans on what is now the West Coast of the United States.

The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been seen to distinguish civilizations from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in class-based distinctions between a high culture of the social elite and a low culture, popular culture or folk culture of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to cultural capital.\n\n\nQuestion 17: What was sometimes used or worn by early humans to form some type of culture visibly?\n\n# Segment 18: Culture\n\nIn the humanities, one sense of culture, as an attribute of the individual, has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication, in the arts, sciences, education, or manners.

The basic body type is a four-legged land-borne animal, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, or on two legs. The largest group of mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables feeding the fetus during gestation.\n\n\nQuestion 1: Which specific mammal is the largest today?\n\n# Segment 2: Mammal\n\nMammals include the largest animals on the planet, the rorquals and other large whales, as well as some of the most intelligent, such as elephants, primates, including humans, and cetaceans.

The largest group of mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables feeding the fetus during gestation.\n\n\nQuestion 3: Which four legged mammal is considered to be the smartest?\n\n# Segment 4: Near_East\n\nNear East (French: Proche-Orient) is a geographical term that roughly encompasses Western Asia. Despite having varying definitions within different academic circles, the term was originally applied to the maximum extent of the Ottoman Empire. The term has fallen into disuse in English, and has been replaced by the term Middle East.\n\n\nQuestion 4: What has replaced the term Near East?\n\n# Segment 5: Near_East\n\nThe Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica defines the Near East as including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the West Bank, and Yemen. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations defines the region similarly, but also includes Afghanistan while excluding the countries of North Africa and the Palestinian territories.

Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius, yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague. Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists, and as the patron defender of herds and flocks.\n\n\nQuestion 7: What is the name of Apollo's son?\n\n# Segment 8: Apollo\n\nAs the patron of Delphi (Pythian Apollo), Apollo was an oracular god\u2014the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle.

Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists, and as the patron defender of herds and flocks.\n\n\nQuestion 9: What was the term for hymns sung to Apollo?\n\n# Segment 10: Mammal\n\nThe word \"mammal\" is modern, from the scientific name Mammalia coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, derived from the Latin mamma (\"teat, pap\"). All female mammals nurse their young with milk, which is secreted from special glands, the mammary glands. According to Mammal Species of the World, 5,416 species were known in 2006.\n\n\nQuestion 10: Who coined the name \"mammal\" from the scientific name Mammalia?\n\n# Segment 11: Mammal\n\nThe word \"mammal\" is modern, from the scientific name Mammalia coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, derived from the Latin mamma (\"teat, pap\").

The Balkan states, with the partial exception of Bosnia and Albania, were primarily Christian. Starting in 1894 the Ottomans struck at the Armenians on the explicit grounds that they were a non-Muslim people and as such were a potential threat to the Muslim empire within which they resided.\n\n\nQuestion 13: How was the Ottoman Empire portrayed in the press?\n\n# Segment 14: Near_East\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, believed to be about to collapse, was portrayed in the press as the sick man of Europe\". The Balkan states, with the partial exception of Bosnia and Albania, were primarily Christian.

The spelling \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd (pronounced [a.p\u00f3l.l\u0254\u02d0n] in Classical Attic) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era, but the Doric form Apellon (\u1f08\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd), is more archaic, derived from an earlier *\u1f08\u03c0\u03ad\u03bbj\u03c9\u03bd. It probably is a cognate to the Doric month Apellaios (\u1f08\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2), and the offerings apellaia (\u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai (\u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9).\n\n\nQuestion 16: What Doric word originally meant wall or fence for animals?\n\n# Segment 17: Apollo\n\nSeveral instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9 (apollymi), \"to destroy\". Plato in Cratylus connects the name with \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (apolysis), \"redemption\", with \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (apolousis), \"purification\", and with \u1f01\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd ([h]aploun), \"simple\", in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, \u1f0c\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, and finally with \u1f08\u03b5\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd (aeiballon), \"ever-shooting\".\n\n\nQuestion 17: What Doric word means assembly?\n\n# Segment 18: Apollo\n\nSeveral instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9 (apollymi), \"to destroy\".

Some historians contend that the conflict in Asia can be dated back to 7 July 1937 with the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China, or possibly 19 September 1931, beginning with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. However, it is more widely accepted that the Pacific War itself started in early December 1941, with the Sino-Japanese War then becoming part of it as a theater of the greater World War II.[nb 9]\n\n\nQuestion 4: Which countries did the Second Sino-Japanese War encompass?\n\n# Segment 5: Pacific_War\n\nIt is generally considered that the Pacific War began on 7/8 December 1941, on which date Japan invaded Thailand and attacked the British possessions of Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong as well as the United States military bases in Hawaii, Wake Island, Guam and the Philippines.

An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave.\n\n\nQuestion 7: What particles are pushed through the antenna by a transmitter?\n\n# Segment 8: Antenna_(radio)\n\nTypically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter.

In Latin texts, on the other hand, Joseph Fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with Sol among the Augustan poets of the 1st century, not even in the conjurations of Aeneas and Latinus in Aeneid XII (161\u2013215). Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE.\n\n\nQuestion 10: Who was the Titan goddess of the moon?\n\n# Segment 11: Apollo\n\nIn Hellenistic times, especially during the 3rd century BCE, as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios, Titan god of the sun, and his sister Artemis similarly equated with Selene, Titan goddess of the moon.

The war culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other large aerial bomb attacks by the United States Army Air Forces, accompanied by the Soviet invasion of Manchuria on 8 August 1945, resulting in the Japanese announcement of intent to surrender on 15 August 1945. The formal and official surrender of Japan took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945.\n\n\nQuestion 13: Where did Japan's surrender occur?\n\n# Segment 14: Pacific_War\n\nThe Pacific War saw the Allied powers pitted against the Empire of Japan, the latter briefly aided by Thailand and to a much lesser extent by its Axis allies, Germany and Italy.

The war culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other large aerial bomb attacks by the United States Army Air Forces, accompanied by the Soviet invasion of Manchuria on 8 August 1945, resulting in the Japanese announcement of intent to surrender on 15 August 1945. The formal and official surrender of Japan took place aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945.\n\n\nQuestion 15: What was the process called whereby the leader of Japan stepped down?\n\n# Segment 16: Antenna_(radio)\n\nThe origin of the word antenna relative to wireless apparatus is attributed to Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi. In the summer of 1895, Marconi began testing his wireless system outdoors on his father's estate near Bologna and soon began to experiment with long wire \"aerials\". Marconi discovered that by raising the \"aerial\" wire above the ground and connecting the other side of his transmitter to ground, the transmission range was increased.\n\n\nQuestion 16: What is a way to increase the strength of a radio transmission?\n\n# Segment 17: Antenna_(radio)\n\nThe origin of the word antenna relative to wireless apparatus is attributed to Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi. In the summer of 1895, Marconi began testing his wireless system outdoors on his father's estate near Bologna and soon began to experiment with long wire \"aerials\". Marconi discovered that by raising the \"aerial\" wire above the ground and connecting the other side of his transmitter to ground, the transmission range was increased.\n\n\nQuestion 17: How far was Marconi able to get his signal to go using this technique?\n\n# Segment 18: Antenna_(radio)\n\nAntennas are required by any radio receiver or transmitter to couple its electrical connection to the electromagnetic field. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves which carry signals through the air (or through space) at the speed of light with almost no transmission loss. Radio transmitters and receivers are used to convey signals (information) in systems including broadcast (audio) radio, television, mobile telephones, Wi-Fi (WLAN) data networks, trunk lines and point-to-point communications links (telephone, data networks), satellite links, many remote controlled devices such as garage door openers, and wireless remote sensors, among many others.\n\n\nQuestion 18: What is essential for the mating of the elements that create radio waves?\n",

    "prompt": "# Segment 1: LaserDisc\n\nAlthough the format was capable of offering higher-quality video and audio than its consumer rivals, the VHS and Betamax videocassette systems, LaserDisc never managed to gain widespread use in North America, largely due to high costs for the players and video titles themselves and the inability to record TV programming. It also remained a largely obscure format in Europe and Australia. By contrast, the format was much more popular in Japan and in the more affluent regions of Southeast Asia, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, being the prevalent rental video medium in Hong Kong during the 1990s.\n\n\nQuestion 1: Did LaserDisks offer higher or lower quality sound and picture than VHS?\n\n# Segment 2: LaserDisc\n\nAlthough the format was capable of offering higher-quality video and audio than its consumer rivals, the VHS and Betamax videocassette systems, LaserDisc never managed to gain widespread use in North America, largely due to high costs for the players and video titles themselves and the inability to record TV programming.

By contrast, the format was much more popular in Japan and in the more affluent regions of Southeast Asia, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, being the prevalent rental video medium in Hong Kong during the 1990s.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Why didn't LaserDisk gain popularity in North America?\n\n# Segment 3: LaserDisc\n\nAlthough the format was capable of offering higher-quality video and audio than its consumer rivals, the VHS and Betamax videocassette systems, LaserDisc never managed to gain widespread use in North America, largely due to high costs for the players and video titles themselves and the inability to record TV programming.

Being the oldest domesticated animal, their long association with people has allowed dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior, as well as thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate for other canid species.\n\n\nQuestion 5: What decade had significant studies of dog genes to determine origins?\n\n# Segment 6: Dog\n\nAlthough initially thought to have originated as a manmade variant of an extant canid species (variously supposed as being the dhole, golden jackal, or gray wolf), extensive genetic studies undertaken during the 2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in Eurasia 40,000 years ago.

After going private in 2013, the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune. In 2014 it was the third largest PC vendor in the world after Lenovo and HP.\n\n\nQuestion 7: When did Dell go public?\n\n# Segment 8: Dell\n\nDell was listed at number 51 in the Fortune 500 list, until 2014. After going private in 2013, the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune. In 2014 it was the third largest PC vendor in the world after Lenovo and HP.\n\n\nQuestion 8: Dell is currently the #2 shipper of what?\n\n# Segment 9: Dell\n\nDell was listed at number 51 in the Fortune 500 list, until 2014. After going private in 2013, the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune. In 2014 it was the third largest PC vendor in the world after Lenovo and HP.\n\n\nQuestion 9: In which state is Dell the sixth smallest company?\n\n# Segment 10: LaserDisc\n\nPioneer Electronics later purchased the majority stake in the format and marketed it as both LaserVision (format name) and LaserDisc (brand name) in 1980, with some releases unofficially referring to the medium as \"Laser Videodisc\". Philips produced the players while MCA produced the discs. The Philips-MCA cooperation was not successful, and discontinued after a few years.\n\n\nQuestion 10: Was Laserdisk officially or unofficially reffered to as \"Laser Videodisc\"?\n\n# Segment 11: LaserDisc\n\nPioneer Electronics later purchased the majority stake in the format and marketed it as both LaserVision (format name) and LaserDisc (brand name) in 1980, with some releases unofficially referring to the medium as \"Laser Videodisc\". Philips produced the players while MCA produced the discs. The Philips-MCA cooperation was not successful, and discontinued after a few years.\n\n\nQuestion 11: Did MCA produce the disc or the players after being bought out?\n\n# Segment 12: LaserDisc\n\nPioneer Electronics later purchased the majority stake in the format and marketed it as both LaserVision (format name) and LaserDisc (brand name) in 1980, with some releases unofficially referring to the medium as \"Laser Videodisc\". Philips produced the players while MCA produced the discs. The Philips-MCA cooperation was not successful, and discontinued after a few years.\n\n\nQuestion 12: Who were the scientists that worked on the early research for Laserdiscs?\n\n# Segment 13: Dog\n\nThe term \"domestic dog\" is generally used for both of the domesticated and feral varieties. The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a \"powerful dog breed\". The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic *dukk\u014dn, represented in Old English finger-docce (\"finger-muscle\").\n\n\nQuestion 13: What is the Proto-Germanic word that \"dog\" may have come from?\n\n# Segment 14: Dog\n\nThe term \"domestic dog\" is generally used for both of the domesticated and feral varieties.

The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a \"powerful dog breed\". The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic *dukk\u014dn, represented in Old English finger-docce (\"finger-muscle\").\n\n\nQuestion 15: Where does the word dog originate?\n\n# Segment 16: Dell\n\nOriginally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company\u2019s Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997. While the industry\u2019s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days.\n\n\nQuestion 16: What market did IBM ignore at first?\n\n# Segment 17: Dell\n\nOriginally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company\u2019s Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997.

The two sports have shared origins and are closely related but have significant differences. In particular, Canadian football has 12 players on the field per team rather than 11; the field is roughly 10 yards wider, and 10 yards longer between end-zones that are themselves 10 yards deeper; and a team has only three downs to gain 10 yards, which results in less offensive rushing than in the American game.\n\n\nQuestion 4: How many downs does a team have to advance ten yards in Canadian football?\n\n# Segment 5: Canadian_football\n\nIn Canada, the term \"football\" may refer to Canadian football and American football collectively, or to either sport specifically, depending on context.

By comparison, escort carriers were developed to provide defense for convoys of ships.\n\n\nQuestion 9: What were few escort carriers built from?\n\n# Segment 10: Portugal\n\nThe land within the borders of current Portugal has been continuously settled and fought over since prehistoric times. The Celts and the Romans were followed by the Visigothic and the Suebi Germanic peoples, who were themselves later invaded by the Moors. These Muslim peoples were eventually expelled during the Christian Reconquista of the peninsula.\n\n\nQuestion 10: What age did Portugal pioneer?\n\n# Segment 11: Portugal\n\nThe land within the borders of current Portugal has been continuously settled and fought over since prehistoric times. The Celts and the Romans were followed by the Visigothic and the Suebi Germanic peoples, who were themselves later invaded by the Moors. These Muslim peoples were eventually expelled during the Christian Reconquista of the peninsula.\n\n\nQuestion 11: In which centuries did Portugal establish the first global empire?\n\n# Segment 12: Portugal\n\nPortugal lost much of its wealth and status with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of Brazil, its wealthiest colony, in 1822. After the 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy, the democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic was established, later being superseded by the \"Estado Novo\" right-wing authoritarian regime. Democracy was restored after the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution in 1974.\n\n\nQuestion 12: In Portugal, which city was destroyed in the 1755 earthquake?\n\n# Segment 13: Zinc\n\nZinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2.\n\n\nQuestion 13: What is zinc chemically identical to?\n\n# Segment 14: Zinc\n\nZinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30.

In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2.\n\n\nQuestion 15: What is used to explode zinc during the production process?\n\n# Segment 16: Aircraft_carrier\n\nThis new-found importance of naval aviation forced nations to create a number of carriers, in efforts to provide air superiority cover for every major fleet in order to ward off enemy aircraft. This extensive usage required the construction of several new 'light' carriers. Escort aircraft carriers, such as USS Bogue, were sometimes purpose-built, but most were converted from merchant ships as a stop-gap measure to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions.\n\n\nQuestion 16: What type of aircraft carrier was the USS Vogue?\n\n# Segment 17: Aircraft_carrier\n\nThis new-found importance of naval aviation forced nations to create a number of carriers, in efforts to provide air superiority cover for every major fleet in order to ward off enemy aircraft.

It is located south of Turkey, west of Syria and Lebanon, northwest of Israel and Palestine, north of Egypt and east of Greece.\n\n\nQuestion 7: Which country is north of Cyprus?\n\n# Segment 8: Cyprus\n\nThe earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC. Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia, and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world. Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC.\n\n\nQuestion 8: What is the date of the earliest known human activity on Cyprus?\n\n# Segment 9: Cyprus\n\nThe earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC.

This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant.\n\n\nQuestion 11: What is another term for uranium ore?\n\n# Segment 12: Uranium\n\nThe discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials.

Even though Turkish Cypriots made up only 18% of the population, the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s. Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an \"extension of Anatolia\" by them; while since the 19th century, the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece, which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s.\n\n\nQuestion 16: What year did the intercommunal violence between Greek and Cypriots occur?\n\n# Segment 17: Cyprus\n\nCyprus was placed under British administration based on Cyprus Convention in 1878 and formally annexed by Britain in 1914.

However, the Republic of Cyprus is de facto partitioned into two main parts; the area under the effective control of the Republic, comprising about 59% of the island's area, and the north, administered by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is recognised only by Turkey, covering about 36% of the island's area. The international community considers the northern part of the island as territory of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by Turkish forces.\n\n\nQuestion 18: The Republic of Cyprus does not have de jure sovereignty over what two British territories? \n",
