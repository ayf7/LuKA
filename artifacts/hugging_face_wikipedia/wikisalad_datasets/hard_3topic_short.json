He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of his era, whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.\" Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, and grew up in Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric's nationalities?\n\n# Segment 2: Asphalt\n\nAsphalt/bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as \"oil sands\" in Alberta, Canada, and the similar \"tar sands\" in Utah, US. The Canadian province of Alberta has most of the world's reserves of natural bitumen, in three huge deposits covering 142,000 square kilometres (55,000 sq mi), an area larger than England or New York state.

The modern Romance languages use equivalents of the English term \"translation\" that are derived from that same Latin source or from the alternative Latin traducere (\"to lead across\" or \"to bring across\").

(sometimes known as Sony Music or by the initials, SME) is an American music corporation managed and operated by Sony Corporation of America (SCA), a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation. In 1929, the enterprise was first founded as American Record Corporation (ARC) and, in 1938, was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation, following ARC's acquisition by CBS.\n\n\nQuestion 4: In what year did it land the name, Sony Music Entertainment?\n\n# Segment 5: Neptune\n\nNeptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Among the giant planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense.\n\n\nQuestion 5: How many Earth years does Neptune orbit the sun? \n\n# Segment 6: Josip_Broz_Tito\n\nHe was General Secretary (later Chairman of the Presidium) of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (1939\u201380), and went on to lead the World War II Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the Partisans (1941\u201345).

Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the gene\u2013environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.\n\n\nQuestion 5: What is one invisible genetic trait?\n\n# Segment 6: United_States_Air_Force\n\nThe U.S. Air Force is a military service organized within the Department of the Air Force, one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense. The Air Force is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Air Force, who reports to the Secretary of Defense, and is appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.\n\n\nQuestion 6: How many departments are there in the Department of Defense?\n",

    "prompt": "# Segment 1: Computer_security\n\nComputer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, is the protection of information systems from theft or damage to the hardware, the software, and to the information on them, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What must an operator deviate from to harm the computer?\n\n# Segment 2: Letter_case\n\nThe terms upper case and lower case can be written as two consecutive words, connected with a hyphen (upper-case and lower-case), or as a single word (uppercase and lowercase). These terms originated from the common layouts of the shallow drawers called type cases used to hold the movable type for letterpress printing. Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate case that was located above the case that held the small letters, and the name proved easy to remember since capital letters are taller.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Besides being a single word or two separate words, how can the words uppercase and lowercase be expressed?\n\n# Segment 3: Economy_of_Greece\n\nGreece is a developed country with an economy based on the service (82.8%) and industrial sectors (13.3%). The agricultural sector contributed 3.9% of national economic output in 2015. Important Greek industries include tourism and shipping.\n\n\nQuestion 3: How much of Greece's economy is comprised of industrial sectors?\n\n# Segment 4: Computer_security\n\nComputer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, is the protection of information systems from theft or damage to the hardware, the software, and to the information on them, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures.\n\n\nQuestion 4: What are the ways an operator can malpractice?\n\n# Segment 5: Letter_case\n\nThe convention followed by many British publishers (including scientific publishers, like Nature, magazines, like The Economist and New Scientist, and newspapers, like The Guardian and The Times) and U.S. newspapers is to use sentence-style capitalisation in headlines, where capitalisation follows the same rules that apply for sentences. This convention is usually called sentence case.\n\n\nQuestion 5: What is the basis of capitalization standards for the sentence-style capitalization?\n\n# Segment 6: Economy_of_Greece\n\nGreece is a developed country with an economy based on the service (82.8%) and industrial sectors (13.3%). The agricultural sector contributed 3.9% of national economic output in 2015. Important Greek industries include tourism and shipping.\n\n\nQuestion 6: What type of continent is Greece?\n",

Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory.\n\n\nQuestion 2: How would you describe a predator that primarily eats plants?\n\n# Segment 3: Pharmaceutical_industry\n\nBy the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt.\n\n\nQuestion 3: As an inhaler, what was epinephrine used to treat?\n\n# Segment 4: Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey\n\nIt is on Absecon Island, on the Atlantic coast.

Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory.\n\n\nQuestion 2: How would you describe a predator that primarily eats plants?\n\n# Segment 3: Seven_Years%27_War\n\nThe Seven Years' War was fought between 1755 and 1764, the main conflict occurring in the seven-year period from 1756 to 1763. It involved every great power of the time except the Ottoman Empire, and affected Europe, the Americas, West Africa, India, and the Philippines. Considered a prelude to the two world wars and the greatest European war since the Thirty Years War of the 17th century, it once again split Europe into two coalitions, led by Great Britain on one side and France on the other.\n\n\nQuestion 3: What major power of the time was not involved in The Seven Years' War?\n\n# Segment 4: Supreme_court\n\nHowever, not all highest courts are named as such. Civil law states do not tend to have singular highest courts. Additionally, the highest court in some jurisdictions is not named the \"Supreme Court\", for example, the High Court of Australia; this is because decisions by the High Court could formerly be appealed to the Privy Council.\n\n\nQuestion 4: What Canadian courts also are not specifically the highest courts in that country?\n\n# Segment 5: Predation\n\nIn an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory.\n\n\nQuestion 5: How would you describe a diet of a species that eats primarily dead organic material? \n\n# Segment 6: Seven_Years%27_War\n\nRealizing that war was imminent, Prussia preemptively struck Saxony and quickly overran it. The result caused uproar across Europe. Because of Prussia's alliance with Britain, Austria formed an alliance with France, seeing an opportunity to recapture Silesia, which had been lost in a previous war.\n\n\nQuestion 6: Who made the first strike of the Seven Years' War?\n",

    "prompt": "# Segment 1: Institute_of_technology\n\nInstitute of technology (also: university of technology, polytechnic university, technikon, and technical college) is a designation employed for a wide range of learning institutions awarding different types of degrees and operating often at variable levels of the educational system. It may be an institution of higher education and advanced engineering and scientific research or professional vocational education, specializing in science, engineering, and technology or different sorts of technical subjects. It may also refer to a secondary education school focused in vocational training.[citation needed] The term institute of technology is often abbreviated IT and is not to be confused with information technology.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What's a common abbreviation for the term institute of technology?\n\n# Segment 2: Catalan_language\n\nCatalan (/\u02c8k\u00e6t\u0259l\u00e6n/; autonym: catal\u00e0 [k\u0259t\u0259\u02c8la] or [kata\u02c8la]) is a Romance language named for its origins in Catalonia, in what is northeastern Spain and adjoining parts of France. It is the national and only official language of Andorra, and a co-official language of the Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Valencia (where the language is known as Valencian, and there exist regional standards). It also has semi-official status in the city of Alghero on the Italian island of Sardinia.\n\n\nQuestion 2: What type of language is Catalan?\n\n# Segment 3: Karl_Popper\n\nPopper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method, in favour of empirical falsification: A theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can and should be scrutinized by decisive experiments. He used the black swan fallacy to discuss falsification. If the outcome of an experiment contradicts the theory, one should refrain from ad hoc manoeuvres that evade the contradiction merely by making it less falsifiable.\n\n\nQuestion 3: What is necessary for a scientific theory to be falsified?\n\n# Segment 4: Institute_of_technology\n\nThe English term polytechnic appeared in the early 19th century, from the French \u00c9cole Polytechnique, an engineering school founded in 1794 in Paris. The French term comes from the Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd (pol\u00fa or pol\u00fd) meaning \"many\" and \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (tekhnik\u00f3s) meaning \"arts\".\n\n\nQuestion 4: What language does the French word polytechnique come from?\n\n# Segment 5: Catalan_language\n\nAccording to the Statistical Institute of Catalonia in 2008 the Catalan language is the second most commonly used in Catalonia, after Spanish, as a native or self-defining language. The Generalitat of Catalunya spends part of its annual budget on the promotion of the use of Catalan in Catalonia and in other territories.\n\n\nQuestion 5: What is the second most often spoken language is Catalonia?\n\n# Segment 6: Karl_Popper\n\nPopper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method, in favour of empirical falsification: A theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can and should be scrutinized by decisive experiments. He used the black swan fallacy to discuss falsification.

More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and scientific studies have used techniques including bird ringing and satellite tracking. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.\n\n\nQuestion 6: When was migration first recorded?\n",

In 1879, the German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as \"the living together of unlike organisms.\"\n\n\nQuestion 5: When did Heinrich Anton de Bary discover lichens?\n\n# Segment 6: Geography_of_the_United_States\n\nFrom 1989 through 1996, the total area of the US was listed as 9,372,610 km2 (3,618,780 sq mi) (land + inland water only). The listed total area changed to 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi) in 1997 (Great Lakes area and coastal waters added), to 9,631,418 km2 (3,718,711 sq mi) in 2004, to 9,631,420 km2 (3,718,710 sq mi) in 2006, and to 9,826,630 km2 (3,794,080 sq mi) in 2007 (territorial waters added). Currently, the CIA World Factbook gives 9,826,675 km2 (3,794,100 sq mi), the United Nations Statistics Division gives 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi), and the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica gives 9,522,055 km2 (3,676,486 sq mi)(Great Lakes area included but not coastal waters).\n\n\nQuestion 6: What encyclopedia includes both the Great Lakes and coastal waters in the United States square mileage?\n",

Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What are the most diverse group of land plants?\n\n# Segment 2: Greeks\n\nGreek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, but the Greek people have always been centered around the Aegean and Ionian seas, where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age. Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula, the western coast of Asia Minor, the Black Sea coast, Cappadocia in central Anatolia, Egypt, the Balkans, Cyprus, and Constantinople. Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Which two bodies of water are believed to be central to the establishment of the Greek society ?\n\n# Segment 3: Bacteria\n\nBacteria (i/b\u00e6k\u02c8t\u026a\u0259ri\u0259/; singular: bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats.\n\n\nQuestion 3: When is the typical lenght  for bacteria?\n\n# Segment 4: Flowering_plant\n\nThe flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with about 350,000 species.

There are approximately 5\u00d71030 bacteria on Earth, forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals. Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients, with many of the stages in nutrient cycles dependent on these organisms, such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction.\n\n\nQuestion 6: What amount of bacteria can be found in a gram of soil?\n",

    "prompt": "# Segment 1: Uranium\n\nDepleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What kind of uranium is sometimes used to shield radioactive materials in containers?\n\n# Segment 2: Botany\n\nBotany, also called plant science(s) or plant biology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specializes in this field. The term \"botany\" comes from the Ancient Greek word \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 (botan\u0113) meaning \"pasture\", \"grass\", or \"fodder\"; \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 is in turn derived from \u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (boskein), \"to feed\" or \"to graze\".\n\n\nQuestion 2: What does the word botany mean?\n\n# Segment 3: Exhibition_game\n\nAn exhibition game (also known as a friendly, a scrimmage, a demonstration, a preseason game, a warmup match, or a preparation match, depending at least in part on the sport) is a sporting event whose prize money and impact on the player's or the team's rankings is either zero or otherwise greatly reduced. In team sports, matches of this type are often used to help coaches and managers select players for the competitive matches of a league season or tournament. If the players usually play in different teams in other leagues, exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players to learn to work with each other.\n\n\nQuestion 3: What is 'a demonstration' another term for?\n\n# Segment 4: Uranium\n\nDepleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material.\n\n\nQuestion 4: What trait causes depleted uranium to be used in gyroscopic compasses?\n\n# Segment 5: Botany\n\nBotany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans to identify \u2013 and later cultivate \u2013 edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards.\n\n\nQuestion 5: What science led to botany?\n\n# Segment 6: Exhibition_game\n\nAn exhibition game (also known as a friendly, a scrimmage, a demonstration, a preseason game, a warmup match, or a preparation match, depending at least in part on the sport) is a sporting event whose prize money and impact on the player's or the team's rankings is either zero or otherwise greatly reduced.

As the Empire evolved into the Commonwealth, nominations continued to come from the Commonwealth realms, in which the monarch remained head of state.

It is an unofficial but widely-spoken language in Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, and to a lesser extent, the other countries that were once constituent republics of the Soviet Union and former participants of the Eastern Bloc. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the three living members of the East Slavic languages.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What language sub-family is Russian in?\n\n# Segment 2: LaserDisc\n\nAlthough the format was capable of offering higher-quality video and audio than its consumer rivals, the VHS and Betamax videocassette systems, LaserDisc never managed to gain widespread use in North America, largely due to high costs for the players and video titles themselves and the inability to record TV programming. It also remained a largely obscure format in Europe and Australia. By contrast, the format was much more popular in Japan and in the more affluent regions of Southeast Asia, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, being the prevalent rental video medium in Hong Kong during the 1990s.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Why didn't LaserDisk gain popularity in North America?\n\n# Segment 3: Apollo\n\nApollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd, Apoll\u014dn (GEN \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2); Doric: \u1f08\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd, Apell\u014dn; Arcadocypriot: \u1f08\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd, Apeil\u014dn; Aeolic: \u1f0c\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, Aploun; Latin: Apoll\u014d) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. The ideal of the kouros (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis.\n\n\nQuestion 3: Who are the parents of Apollo?\n\n# Segment 4: Russian_language\n\nRussian (\u0440\u0443\u0301\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u0301\u043a, russkiy yazyk, pronounced [\u02c8rusk\u02b2\u026aj j\u026a\u02c8z\u0268k] ( listen)) is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and many minor or unrecognised territories.

Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the three living members of the East Slavic languages.\n\n\nQuestion 4: How many living East Slavic languages are there?\n\n# Segment 5: LaserDisc\n\nLaserDisc was first available on the market, in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1978, two years after the introduction of the VHS VCR, and four years before the introduction of the CD (which is based on laser disc technology). Initially licensed, sold, and marketed as MCA DiscoVision (also known as simply \"DiscoVision\") in North America in 1978, the technology was previously referred to internally as Optical Videodisc System, Reflective Optical Videodisc, Laser Optical Videodisc, and Disco-Vision (with a dash), with the first players referring to the format as \"Video Long Play\".\n\n\nQuestion 5: Where was LaserDisc first available?\n\n# Segment 6: Apollo\n\nAs the patron of Delphi (Pythian Apollo), Apollo was an oracular god\u2014the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle. Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius, yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague. Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists, and as the patron defender of herds and flocks.\n\n\nQuestion 6: Who was described at the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle?\n",

The two main islands are Savai'i and Upolu with four smaller islands surrounding the landmasses. The capital city is Apia.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What was Samoa's old name?\n\n# Segment 2: Post-punk\n\nPost-punk is a heterogeneous type of rock music that emerged in the wake of the punk movement of the 1970s. Drawing inspiration from elements of punk rock while departing from its musical conventions and wider cultural affiliations, post-punk music was marked by varied, experimentalist sensibilities and its \"conceptual assault\" on rock tradition. Artists embraced electronic music, black dance styles and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques.\n\n\nQuestion 2: What did post-punk artists use in their music?\n\n# Segment 3: Identity_(social_science)\n\nA psychological identity relates to self-image (one's mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality. Consequently, Weinreich gives the definition \"A person's identity is defined as the totality of one's self-construal, in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future\"; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as: \"One's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity\" (Weinreich, 1986a).\n\n\nQuestion 3: What psychological concept does Weinreich state as between the past and future?\n\n# Segment 4: Samoa\n\nThe Independent State of Samoa ( Samoan: Malo Sa 'oloto Tuto 'atasi o S\u0101moa, IPA: [\u02ccsa\u02d0\u02c8moa]), commonly known as Samoa (Samoan: S\u0101moa) and formerly known as Western Samoa, is a Unitary Parliamentary Republic with eleven administrative divisions.

The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized).\n\n\nQuestion 2: How many electrical conductors, or plates, do all capacitors contain at a minimum?\n\n# Segment 3: Bird\n\nBirds (Aves) are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.\n\n\nQuestion 3: What is the largest bird?\n\n# Segment 4: Textual_criticism\n\nTextual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants in either manuscripts or printed books.

True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs.\n\n\nQuestion 6: What are the last surviving dinosaurs, according o the fossil record?\n",

A treaty may also be known as an (international) agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms. Regardless of terminology, all of these forms of agreements are, under international law, equally considered treaties and the rules are the same.\n\n\nQuestion 3: How are different forms of agreements treated under international law compared to treaties?\n\n# Segment 4: University\n\nThe original Latin word \"universitas\" refers in general to \"a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc.\" At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds, specialised \"associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located\" came to be denominated by this general term.

Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Empire be placed under his protection. Britain attempted to mediate, and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to.\n\n\nQuestion 6: Which two figures refused to back down after the churches worked out their disagreements?\n",

These steam driven devices were soon being applied to a diverse set of purposes - in 1823, two architects working in London, Burton and Hormer, built and operated a novel tourist attraction, which they called the \"ascending room\".

Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming dynasty's shortage of horses for warfare and thus the importance of the horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship.\n\n\nQuestion 2: What important trade did the Ming Dynasty have with Tibet?\n\n# Segment 3: Muslim_world\n\nThe term Muslim world, also known as Islamic world and the Ummah (Arabic: \u0623\u0645\u0629\u200e, meaning \"nation\" or \"community\") has different meanings. In a religious sense, the Islamic Ummah refers to those who adhere to the teachings of Islam, referred to as Muslims.

Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming dynasty's shortage of horses for warfare and thus the importance of the horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship.\n\n\nQuestion 5: Deshin Shekpa was the head of what school?\n\n# Segment 6: Muslim_world\n\nThe term Muslim world, also known as Islamic world and the Ummah (Arabic: \u0623\u0645\u0629\u200e, meaning \"nation\" or \"community\") has different meanings. In a religious sense, the Islamic Ummah refers to those who adhere to the teachings of Islam, referred to as Muslims. In a cultural sense, the Muslim Ummah refers to Islamic civilization, exclusive of non-Muslims living in that civilization.\n\n\nQuestion 6: What civilization does Ummah refer to when used in a religious sense?\n",

In democracies, political parties are elected by the electorate to run a government.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What are the two most powerful political parties in the United States?\n\n# Segment 2: Chinese_characters\n\nChinese characters are logograms used in the writing of Chinese and some other Asian languages. In Standard Chinese they are called Hanzi (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u5b57; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u5b57). They have been adapted to write a number of other languages including: Japanese, where they are known as kanji, Korean, where they are known as hanja, and Vietnamese in a system known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m.\n\n\nQuestion 2: What are Chinese characters called in standard Chinese?\n\n# Segment 3: Iranian_languages\n\nThe Iranian languages or Iranic languages form a branch of the Indo-Iranian languages, which in turn are a branch of the Indo-European language family. The speakers of Iranian languages are known as Iranian peoples. Historical Iranian languages are grouped in three stages: Old Iranian (until 400 BCE), Middle Iranian (400 BCE \u2013 900 CE), and New Iranian (since 900 CE).\n\n\nQuestion 3: What are Indo-Iranian languages a subset of?\n\n# Segment 4: Political_party\n\nWhile there is some international commonality in the way political parties are recognized, and in how they operate, there are often many differences, and some are significant.

In democracies, political parties are elected by the electorate to run a government.\n\n\nQuestion 4: What are some countries that have multiple powerful political parties?\n\n# Segment 5: Chinese_characters\n\nChinese characters number in the tens of thousands, though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts. Studies in China have shown that functional literacy in written Chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters. In Japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the J\u014dy\u014d kanji); hundreds more are in everyday use.\n\n\nQuestion 5: What requires a knowledge of three to four thousand characters?\n\n# Segment 6: Iranian_languages\n\nThe Iranian languages or Iranic languages form a branch of the Indo-Iranian languages, which in turn are a branch of the Indo-European language family.

It is the world's only contiguous Eurafrasian nation. Most of Egypt's territory of 1,010,408 square kilometres (390,000 sq mi) lies within the Nile Valley.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What 2 continents meet at Egypt?\n\n# Segment 2: Chinese_characters\n\nChinese characters are logograms used in the writing of Chinese and some other Asian languages. In Standard Chinese they are called Hanzi (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u5b57; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u5b57). They have been adapted to write a number of other languages including: Japanese, where they are known as kanji, Korean, where they are known as hanja, and Vietnamese in a system known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m.\n\n\nQuestion 2: What are Chinese characters called in standard Chinese?\n\n# Segment 3: Idealism\n\nIn philosophy, idealism is the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas\u2014especially beliefs and values\u2014shape society.\n\n\nQuestion 3: Along with physicalist theories, what theories is idealism in conflict with?\n\n# Segment 4: Egypt\n\nEgypt (i/\u02c8i\u02d0d\u0292\u026apt/; Arabic: \u0645\u0650\u0635\u0631\u200e Mi\u1e63r, Egyptian Arabic: \u0645\u064e\u0635\u0631 Ma\u1e63r, Coptic: \u2cac\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93 Khemi), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia, via a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula.

Studies in China have shown that functional literacy in written Chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters. In Japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the J\u014dy\u014d kanji); hundreds more are in everyday use.\n\n\nQuestion 5: What requires a knowledge of three to four thousand characters?\n\n# Segment 6: Idealism\n\nIn philosophy, idealism is the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial.

It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What was designed to standardize the connection of computer peripherals?\n\n# Segment 2: Pope_John_XXIII\n\nPope Saint John XXIII (Latin: Ioannes XXIII; Italian: Giovanni XXIII) born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli,[a] Italian pronunciation: [\u02c8and\u0292elo d\u0292u\u02c8z\u025bppe ro\u014b\u02c8kalli]; 25 November 1881 \u2013 3 June 1963) reigned as Pope from 28 October 1958 to his death in 1963 and was canonized on 27 April 2014. Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was the fourth of fourteen children born to a family of sharecroppers who lived in a village in Lombardy.

This kind of design was chosen to prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment, as only the Type-A socket provides power. There are cables with Type-A connectors on both ends, but they should be used carefully.\n\n\nQuestion 4: What are the different kinds of USB connectors?\n\n# Segment 5: Pope_John_XXIII\n\nPope Saint John XXIII (Latin: Ioannes XXIII; Italian: Giovanni XXIII) born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli,[a] Italian pronunciation: [\u02c8and\u0292elo d\u0292u\u02c8z\u025bppe ro\u014b\u02c8kalli]; 25 November 1881 \u2013 3 June 1963) reigned as Pope from 28 October 1958 to his death in 1963 and was canonized on 27 April 2014.

In team sports, matches of this type are often used to help coaches and managers select players for the competitive matches of a league season or tournament. If the players usually play in different teams in other leagues, exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players to learn to work with each other.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What is 'a friendly' another term for?\n\n# Segment 2: Electric_motor\n\nFound in applications as diverse as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives, electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC) sources, such as from the power grid, inverters or generators. Small motors may be found in electric watches. General-purpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use.\n\n\nQuestion 2: What is the main example of a DC power source?\n\n# Segment 3: Gene\n\nA gene is a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product, and is the molecular unit of heredity.:Glossary The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the gene\u2013environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.\n\n\nQuestion 3: What influence are most biological traits under?\n\n# Segment 4: Exhibition_game\n\nAn exhibition game (also known as a friendly, a scrimmage, a demonstration, a preseason game, a warmup match, or a preparation match, depending at least in part on the sport) is a sporting event whose prize money and impact on the player's or the team's rankings is either zero or otherwise greatly reduced.

General-purpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use.\n\n\nQuestion 5: In what device are small motors commonly found?\n\n# Segment 6: Gene\n\nGenes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term \"having a gene\" (e.g., \"good genes,\" \"hair colour gene\") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene.\n\n\nQuestion 6: What do mutations in a gene sequence lead to?\n",

It gained considerable institutional privileges between 1333 and 1370 during the reign of King Casimir III the Great.:211 In 1413, following a series of tentative personal unions between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown Kingdom of Poland, the existing Lithuanian nobility formally joined this class.:211 As the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569\u20131795) evolved and expanded in territory, its membership grew to include the leaders of Ducal Prussia, Podolian and Ruthenian lands.\n\n\nQuestion 3: WHich two kingdoms shared tentative personal unions?\n\n# Segment 4: Southeast_Asia\n\nDefinitions of \"Southeast Asia\" vary, but most definitions include the area represented by the countries (sovereign states and dependent territories) listed below.

The nobility negotiated substantial and increasing political and legal privileges for itself throughout its entire history until the decline of the Polish Commonwealth in the late 18th century.\n\n\nQuestion 6: What is another name for folwarks?\n",
