Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members.\n\n\nQuestion 1: From what language does Universitas come from?\n\n# Segment 2: Age_of_Enlightenment\n\nFrench historians traditionally place the Enlightenment between 1715, the year that Louis XIV died, and 1789, the beginning of the French Revolution. Some recent historians begin the period in the 1620s, with the start of the scientific revolution. The Philosophes, the French term for the philosophers of the period, widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons and coffee houses, and through printed books and pamphlets.\n\n\nQuestion 2: In what year did the French Revolution begin?\n\n# Segment 3: University\n\nThe original Latin word \"universitas\" refers in general to \"a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc.\" At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds, specialised \"associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located\" came to be denominated by this general term.

Much of what is incorporated in the scientific method (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s David Hume and Adam Smith. Hume became a major figure in the skeptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy.\n\n\nQuestion 4: Which moral philosopher said \"the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers\"?\n",
