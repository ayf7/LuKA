Algebraic topology studies topological spaces using tools from abstract algebra, such as groups and rings, to capture their fundamental structural properties. It focuses on concepts like homotopy, homology, and cohomology, which help distinguish spaces by their shapes and connectivity rather than geometric details. This field bridges pure mathematics and geometry, providing insights relevant to modern physics and data analysis.

World War II was a global conflict from 1939 to 1945 that reshaped political, social, and economic landscapes worldwide. It involved the major Allied and Axis powers and introduced unprecedented warfare technologies, from radar to nuclear weapons. The aftermath led to the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers and set the stage for the Cold War.
